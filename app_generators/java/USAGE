Description:

tbox lowers the barrier to entry for test-driven learning by providing a basic infrastructure in which 
to start coding: A directory structure, some classes and unit tests to get started, and a build script
to run all tests. 
  
Usage:
  
$ cd ~/your_projects
$ tbox --java LearnJava
$ ant -f build/build.xml

If you have IntelliJ, open the IPR file to get started with adding your learning tests. If you have
a different IDE, follow the instructions to import your application as existing source.
