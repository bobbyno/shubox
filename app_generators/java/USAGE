Description:

shubox lowers the barrier to entry for test-driven learning by providing a basic infrastructure in which
to start coding: A directory structure, some classes and unit tests to get started, and a build script
to run all tests.

Usage:

	$ shubox -l=java /tmp/LearnJava
	$ cd /tmp/LearnJava
	$ ant -f build/build.xml

If you have IntelliJ, open the IPR file to get started with adding your learning tests. If you have
a different IDE, follow the instructions to import your application as existing source.
