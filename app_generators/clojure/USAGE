Description:

shubox lowers the barrier to entry for test-driven learning by providing a basic infrastructure in which
to start coding: A directory structure, some classes and unit tests to get started, and a build script
to run all tests.

Usage:

 $ shubox -l=clojure /tmp/learn_clojure
 $ cd /tmp/learn_clojure
 $ bin/runtests.sh

If you have IntelliJ, install the La Clojure plugin, then open the IPR file to get started with adding 
your learning tests. If you have a different IDE, follow the instructions to import your application as 
existing source.
