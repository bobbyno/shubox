Description:

shubox lowers the barrier to entry for test-driven learning by providing a basic infrastructure in which
to start coding: A directory structure, some classes and unit tests to get started, a Rakefile to run
all tests, and cleaners to delete test implementations and facilitate repetition.

Usage:

	$ shubox /tmp/learn_ruby
	$ cd /tmp/learn_ruby
	$ rake
